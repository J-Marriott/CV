### <a name="about_me">About Me</a>
***

I am an enthusiastic, outgoing and ambitious person looking forward to starting my career in tech. Enthralled by technology and computers from an early age I decided it was about time I learnt how to code. I started my journey with codecademy courses before deciding to step it up a notch by applying to one of Europe's leading development bootcamps.<br><br>

Currently I am enrolled at Makers Academy for the remote course starting in January.<br><br>

**Communication**<br>
In my previous roles I have worked with a wide range of customers, patients and employees with varying ages and levels of expertise in their fields. I believe communication is key to a successful working relationship whether it's explaining a tricky technical concept to somebody, giving a presentation, asking for assistance or even just providing an update on the current status of a project I'm working on. I pride myself on my ability on to adjust my approach depending on the target audience and prevent any miscommunication from occurring.<br><br>
**Critical Reasoning and Problem Solving**<br>
Another skill I have improved during my time in education and employment is my ability to critically analyse situations and provide simple solutions to problems. Working as a physiotherapist I regularly had to think on my feet and alter treatments accordingly for the benefit my patients. Working in sport I was often the first responder to incidents on the field of play and had to be alert and ready to provide emergency first aid working with both youth level and professional athletes.<br><br>
